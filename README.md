# Design Patterns

## 1. Factory Pattern
- Pattern for creating multiple different instances of a class & allowing the subclasses to alter the type of instances that will be created

```swift
protocol CoffeeFactory { 
    func makeCoffee(name: String) -> Coffee 
}
struct LatteFactory: CoffeeFactory {
    func makeCoffee(name: String) -> Coffee {
        return Coffee(name: name)
    }
}
struct AmericanoFactory: CoffeeFactory {
    func makeCoffee(name: String) -> Coffee {
        return Coffee(name: name)
    }
} 
```
When you want to create a new coffee object:

```swift
func makeAndServeCoffee(factory: CoffeeFactory, name: String) {
    let coffee = factory.makeCoffee(name: name) 
    coffee.serveCoffee()
}

let latteFactory = LatteFactory() 
makeAndServeCoffee(factory: latteFactory, name: "Latte")
```

## 2. Singleton Pattern

Class with a single shared instance, implemented with a static constant/method.
- Child class can't override static var or func.
- Uses: Network Manager, User Defaults, Location Sharing, Notification Manager, etc.
- Pros: Global Access, Lazy Initialisation, Centralised Configuration (settings), Resource Sharing 
- Cons: Anti-Pattern, Hard to test global & tightly coupled code, Race Conditions if there's thread conflicts
